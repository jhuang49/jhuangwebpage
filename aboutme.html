			<h3>How I became me</h3>
			<p>People tend to have completely different opinions on me and I don't blame them. To my acquaintances, I appear stoic, responsible, and fit. They think i spend my day counting my protein in-take and doing curls.</p>
			<p>	To my friends and family, I am a complete nerd who has an unhealthy obsession with superheros. I love playing video games with friends and messing around with computer software and coding. Both of these groups will agree that I am a pretty funny guy who likes to make sure everyone is having a great time.</p>
			<h4>influence</h4>
			<p>My diverse personality traits definitely stem from my parents, who are as polar opposite as a couple can get. My parents are small business owners who have completely philosophies who it comes to managing their businesses.</p>
			<p>	My mom is strict, no non-sense boss who prioritizes employee efficiency and financial stability. She is walked around classrooms making sure the tutors are doing their job and the students are making progress.</p>
			<p>My dad, on the other hand, walked around the office with a grin and jokes to tell. He is always making sure the students and employees are happy and comfortable in the workspace. In his free time, he is fixing broken TV and computer hardware parts for fun.</p>

			<h3> Work Ethic </h3>
				<p> I will be the first to tell you that I am not the smartest guy in the room. I pride myself in my motor and work ethic. I love to learn and analyze a concept inside-out until I know it like the back of my hand.</p>
				<p> I am not afraid to say I don't know something but I will absolutely not take the easy way out and let someone else do my work.</p>
				<p> I have always been someone who works for beyond the personal benefits. I wish to become involving employee of a company and make whatever sacrifices needed to help the company succeed. </p>
