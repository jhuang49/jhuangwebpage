        	<p class="padright">People tend to have completely different opinions on me and i don't blame them. To my acquaintances, i appear stoic, responsible, and fit. They think i spend my day counting my protein in-take and doing curls. To my friends and family, I am a complete nerd who has an unhealthy obsession with superheros. I love playing video games with friends and messing around with computer software and coding. Both of these groups will agree that I am a pretty funny guy who likes to make sure everyone is having a great time.</p>

        <div class="six columns">
       	  <p class="padleft">My diverse personality traits definitely stem from my parents, who are as polar opposite as a couple can get. My parents are small business owners who have completely philosophies who it comes to managing their businesses. My mom is strict, no non-sense boss who prioritizes employee efficiency and financial stability. She is walked around classrooms making sure the tutors are doing their job and the students are making progress. My dad, on the other hand, walked around the office with a grin and jokes to tell. He is always making sure the students and employees are happy and comfortable in the workspace. In his free time, he is fixing broken TV and computer hardware parts for fun.        </p>
